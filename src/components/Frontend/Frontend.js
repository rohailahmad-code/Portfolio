        subdetail="A portfolio website is a unique way to showcase your work and let others know about 
        yourself. Itâ€™s like an evergreen platform for your projects, case studies, and information about 
        you. In addition, itâ€™s one of the best ways to express your personality, experience, and capabilities.
        Having your own website means customers are always able to find you and if interested, reach out for 
        you. If you donâ€™t have an online presence nowadays, you are behind the times. ðŸ˜‰ A portfolio is a great 
        way for photographers, designers, developers and a wide range of artists to present their work online. 
        It lets you reflect your identity through your works â€“ photos, graphic design, sketches, etc."

        para="Back in 2019 when I was learning front end web development I had learned too many things like HTML 
        syntax, elements, different tags, class, id, adding stylesheet, meta tags, and tables in HTML, and I also 
        covered CSS topics like selectors, declaration block, key and value pair, flexbox, grid, etc. There are so 
        many other topics that I can't name them here because they will become very lengthy. I was thinking to do 
        some real work with hands-on experience so I google it and find a very good platform called 'FRONTEND MENTOR'. 
        I really liked the platform so much they are doing such a great job because they are providing free designs 
        with all the assets and provide you all the instructions about the project that how you will do it so I choose 
        this Portfolio landing page and read all the instructions and download it. It seems to me like a tough game but 
        I didn't give up and started it. The FrontEnd Mentor will provide you with colors, fonts, font size, design, 
        responsive design for mobile, and photos. I think this is one of the best platform for a newbie. So come to the 
        topic, this website is a one-page static website it doesn't have any other page and it won't redirect you to 
        another page. You can check the Landing page by clicking the below link."

        for experience and practice purpose. I made this along time ago it have been more than 2 years at that time i wasn't that much good at
        coding. I just tried and made this. First I made a wireframes for the website because wireframes are very important in case  if you don't
        have a design or prototype. After wireframes i search for fonts and colors. Font and Colors are the most imporatant element of the 
        website if you choose good font and colors your website well look awesome. You can check the website by clicking the below link."
