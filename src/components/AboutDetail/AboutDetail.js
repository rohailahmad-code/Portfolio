        <h1>About</h1>
        <p className='intro'>Hi, I'm Rohail Ahmad. I'm a multi-talented human 
        with over 3 years of experiences in wide range of Front-end Web Development.</p>

        <p>You can also call me a Front-end Web Developer. Goal-oriented Front-end Web Developer for the last 3 years and looking
        to build up my professional experience with Freelancing and Real Work. Armed with a deep
        sense of responsibility.</p>

        <p>I dont't like to define myself by the work I've done. I define myself by the
        work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning,
        continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.</p>

        <p>Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I'm easily inspired and more then willing
        to follow my facinations wherever they take me. I'm passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability
        to entertain and inspire. I'm never satisfied to just come with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.</p>

        <p>My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I'm a fast 
        learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.</p>

        <p>I like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the course of my life and career. My personality type is INFJ-T. I am open for new opportunities.</p>

        <p>You can read more about my experience, skills, education and much more in the PDF attached bellow:</p>
